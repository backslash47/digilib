CHANGES

13.8.2002 - [different files] : roc

- changed all hardcoded occurrences of /docuserver/digitallibrary to
  work relative or take the path from the request URL. Introduced a
  variable baseURL to hold the URL path (up to digilib.jsp etc.). Now
  it should be possible to install digilib in other directories.

20.05.2002 - navigation_o6.js : luginbuehl

- Opera browser support done. the 'b'-key does not work currently, beause
  Opera uses this key on its own - have to work something out...

18.05.2002 - [different files] : luginbuehl

- works on Opera browser support (functionality is getting better, menu 
  still has lots of errors)
- working on a Opera version that does work independantly of the http
  browser imitation set (though!)

18.05.2002 - modules/pagesTotal.js : luginbuehl

- fixied an error in function page(keepArea) which did not work on all 
  browsers correctly.
