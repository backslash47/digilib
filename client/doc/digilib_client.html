<hr>

<h3>1 Introduction</h3>

<p>
Digilib is a client-server-software that transforms high-resolution images to
formats that are acceptable for internet network connetions. the client software
is based on HTML and JavaScript so that everybody can use it with a normal
browser. To see in full detail which browsers and platforms are supported check
chapter 4.1. This software provides lots of features like zooming areas of
pictures, setting marks to the pictures, jumping to different pictures while
always being able to generate URLs so that people can distibute these and
everybody can see the same picture with ist marks.<br>
It has been put lots of attention providing files that are as intependant of
each other as possible so that embedding it in other kind of pages will be as
simple as it can be. Stuff like providing modules or a different menubar are
just some of the stuff you can easily do without having to change the files
provided.
</p>
<p>
Some of the the client-files contain JSP code, to do some serverside
configuration. Because of the fact that the serverside software has to use a
java module for the web-server there is no need to install more stuff than what
is needed by the server-scripts.
</p>
<p>
This software is still work in progress and it is quite probable that lots of
stuff will change in the future, so check this file with every new version of
software you downloaded.
</p>

<h3>2 Files</h3>

<p>
There are quite some files the client software needs to run all the interactive
user-interface. To give you a detailed view of the files there is a subsection
provided in this document explaining what each file does and how it interacts
with the others.
</p>

<h4>2.1 digilib.jsp</h4>

<p>
This is the file you will request from the server and which will call the
other files. The main purposes of this file are:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>User authentication when wanting to access restriced documents. Check out
     the serverside documentation for detailed explanation of how to set it
     up.</li>
 <li>Converting the query-string to the servlet style parameters (because of some 
     historical reasons the two parameter-sets are not equal and a project at the 
     Univerity of Berne based on digilib requires the first kind of parameters. So
     for the moment we have to live with it...)</li>
 <li>Building the frameset for the different frames like the one actually holding
     the image, one for navigation, etc.. It's up to the developer of a certain
     application to change it to its needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The crutial point in this file is the way the query on the URL (get-method) is
made. After <kbd>digilib.jsp?</kbd> there is a comma-separated list of parameters. It is
to say that principally all of them are optional, but the first of them
describing the url of the image-directory should really be set.<br>
Here is the list of the diffenent attributes in
<kbd>digilib.jsp?[att0]+[att1]+[att2]+[att3]+[att4]+ ... +[att8]</kbd>: 
</p>

<table border="0" align="center" width="95%">
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att0]</td>
  <td>Directory where the image can be found (check the documentation for
      serverside).</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att1]</td>
  <td>The page number (equals the index of the image in the sorted directory).</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att2]</td>
  <td>The dimension relative to the visible height/width in the frame (1.0 means
      that the image fits exactly into the frame, while 2.0 means twice that
      size).</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att3]</td>
  <td>Attribute to pass extra options to the servlet (for example 'fit' means
      that normally not resized gif-images will be scaled).</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att4]</td>
  <td>Here are the marks passed separated by ';', while the coordinates are
      separated with '/'. The cooridnates are in a relative format (0.0 -
      1.0).<br>
      Example ... +0.33/0.5;0.25/0.25+ ... means that there are two marks one a
      third from the left and half down the image and the second a quarter from
      left and top of the image.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att5]</td>
  <td>Relative (0.0 - 1.0) value giving the most left pixels visible in the
      zoomed image.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att6]</td>
  <td>Dito with the topmost pixels.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att7]</td>
  <td>Gives the visible width of the image (also 0.0 - 1.0).</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">[att8]</td>
  <td>Same with the height.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
It is important to understand that all cooridnates that are used by digilib are
passed as relative values where the width/height of an image is 1. This way it
is possible that the images are displayed the same way on all kind of different
screen-sizes and so making opening the possibility of sharing a url between
people that will see the same on their screens.
</p>

<h4>2.2 dlImage.jsp</h4>

<p>
The parameterlist in dlImage.jsp is quite the same as in digilib.jsp but is
represented in another format. As in chapter 2.1 we are discussing here the
parameterlist. The parameters are no longer separated with the plus-sign put
with an ampersand '&', which is the official way of passing different parameters
through the URL. The parameters have all a name followed by a value, like <kbd>
.../dlImage.jsp?fn=histbot/botany&pn=3& ... </kbd>. I will give you now a list of
parameters dlImage.jsp understands by default by indication the name and its
equivalent in digilib.jsp and if needed some special comments. It is possible
and the somehow the aim of dlImage to pass more parameters to this file for
additional functionality. Check out section 2.5.1 where is a good example of how
to modify dlImage.jsp for adding new functionality.
</p>

<table border="0" align="center" width="95%">
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">fn</td>
  <td>= att0</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">pn</td>
  <td>= att1</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">ws</td>
  <td>= att2</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">mo</td>
  <td>= att3</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">mk</td>
  <td>= att4</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">wx</td>
  <td>= att5</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">wy</td>
  <td>= att6</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">ww</td>
  <td>= att7</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">wh</td>
  <td>= att8</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">dx</td>
  <td>Width of the frame containing the to be displayed image in pixels.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="8%" valign="top">dy</td>
  <td>Dito with the height.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
DlImage.jsp can react in two completely different ways on a request. When
requesting the file it checks whether the width and height of the frame are
passed as parameters in the URL. This is not the case on every first view of a
session. If the dimensions are not set, then dlImage sends a dummy page to the
client, calculates the width and height of the frame (which is only possible
with a correct html-file) and resends the request to dlImage.jsp this time with
the indicated dimensions.
</p>
<p>
The other way dlImage.jsp reacts is its noraml reaction. This means that it
parses the parameterslist and fills in some default values if they are missing
(check out the source-code to see them). Then the file is going to include some
script files that do offer the functionality. Part of these JavaScript-files are
browser dependant, some are not. The most important files are named with
navigation_XX.js where XX is a shortcut for the browser. The other files (the
ones not browser-dependant) are some sample modules that are discussed in
section 2.5.<br>
Then it is time to build the actual HTML for the frame. There is one layer
holding the picture (the way the parameters should be passed is described in the
serverside dokumentaion). The layers named 'dotX' are the layers holding the
marks, the ones named 'eckX' are the corners when zooming a rectangle.<br>
Last but not least the parameters are passed to the navigation-script or the the
module using them (<kbd>&lt;body bgcolor="#666666" onload='init_XXXXX("&lt;%= fn ...
")'&gt;</kbd>).
</p>

<h4>2.3 navigation_XX.js</h4>

<p>
Let's look at the crucail points about navigation_XX.js-files. Most important is
that the parameters passed to the init-function are stored in an array globally
accesible (the code in init shows this). The name of the array is 'att'. There
is also a function called 'loadPicture' that puts together a new URL
(dlImage.jsp?...) for loading a new picture or another part of the same. Then we
have lots of functions dealing with different parts of the digilib
functionality:
</p>

<table border="0" align="center" width="95%">
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">backPage</td>
  <td>Loading the previous picture in the directory.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">nextPage</td>
  <td>Loading the next picture in the directory.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">page</td>
  <td>Loading a picture in the same directory by index.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">digicat</td>
  <td>Loading a new window containing thumbnails of images in the directoy (some
      closely related project called 'digicat').</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">ref</td>
  <td>Generating HTML- or LaTeX-style links for the special part of picture
      including marks to build into other documents. The URL is made with
      <kbd>digilib.jsp?...+... </kbd>.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">mark</td>
  <td>Sets a mark to the current picture.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">zoomArea</td>
  <td>Zooms an area of the current picture.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">zoomPoint</td>
  <td>Zooms in around the selected point on the picture.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">moveTo</td>
  <td>Moves the center of a image area to this point while maintaining the same
      zooming grade (sometimes this is known as 'pan').</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td width="10%" valign="top">scale</td>
  <td>Scales an image relative to the dimensions of the image-frame (normally
      the image fits right into it).</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
The other functions are helpers that are should not be directly accessed from
outside the frame.
</p>

<h4>2.4 dlMenu.html</h4>

<p>
This file generates the navigation-frame with buttons and menus. From this point
the calls are made to navigation_XX.js. Please consider this frame as a sample
the we at the University of Berne are currently using. If you are good in
graphics design feel free to create your own buttons.<br>
The files related to dlMenu.html are in a subdirectory called 'buttons' where
the gif-images are stored and also the menu.js-scripts handling the menus.
</p>

<h4>2.5 Modules</h4>

<p>
The modules form a very important part of the whole project. This software aims
to be easy to upgrade with new functionality. Because of the fact that
JavaScript is not a full featured programming language modularisation  in so
that intuitive and simple. Still we have found a way of providing enough freedom
to build new modules and adding features to digilib. The example of two sample
modules (that are nevertheless useful), we would like to show how we think one
should implement another module to add new functionality.
</p>

<h5>2.5.1 pdfMaker.js</h5>

<p>
In the subdirectory 'modules' is a very simple module called pdfMaker.js. This
very basic module only has one function (makePDF) that does nothing more than
giving a prompt where one can enter a number of image-indices and call a
serverside script that creates a PDF-file with the different picures. To make
this module work it has first to be loaded by dlImage.jsp. Because it is
browser-independant there is only one version of it. Aften being loaded it has
access to the whole 'att'-array which is quite stupidely shown in makePDF by
giving the index of the currently displayed image as default value.<br>
One other thing that has to be done is to enter a new button to navigation.html
so that the new function can be called... quite logic i know.
</p>

<h5>2.5.2 pagesTotal.js</h5>

<p>
'pagesTotal.js' is a lot more complicated than the first module and shows some
more things to think of when making a module. It aims to show the current
pagenumber (index) and the total number of images in the directory in a
separated frame. The first thing that has to be done is implementing a new frame
in diglib.jsp to provide space to write down the information.<br>
As we know the current index is stored in the parameter 'pn' in dlImage.jsp and
easily accessible in the scripts with 'att[1]', where as the total number of
pages is only known by the server. To get this information one has to make a
call to a server function. This is done in digilib.jsp (query += "&pt=" +
DB.getNumPages(request);) the resulting number that should not cheange during a
session is stored in a new parameter 'pt' that is sent in the parameter-list to
dlImage.jsp.<br>
In dlImage we have to load the module (configure 2.5.1). Next thing is to make
the 'pt' accessible through all the scripts (adding a new cell to the
'att'-array) by creating an init'function in the module. While the original
function is called 'init' the one in pagesTotal is called 'init_pagesTotal' and
acception the additional parameter 'pt'. In 'init_pagesTotal' there is a call to
the original 'init' with all parameters but 'pt' and so filling the first nine
cells of the att-array. Then it's time to add a new cell with 'pt' as its value.
Further on there is a call to function 'pagesTotal' that writes the data into
the new frame.<br>
As you can see there are some functions overriding the original ones.
'nextPage', 'page' and 'loadPicture' are rewritten in the module to make use of
the new functionality. In the first two functions we can make now some
additional checks that we cannot run past the last image. 'loadPicture' has to
be improved so that 'pt' will be in the URL sent when loading a new picture or
area.
</p>


<h3>3 Future</h3>

<p>
There are some future plans concerning the cilent software. While there is no
actual list of things that have to be done, but some vague ideas of
improvements:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Cleaning up the different stiles of holding the parameters.</li>
 <li>Makeing some handy generic functions like mouseclicks or mousemoves so that
     they can be used in modules.</li>
 <li>Makeing the implementation of modules clearer, easier and safer than it is
     now. In JavaScript there are some (rudimentary?) object-oriented ideas that
     might help improving it - but I didn't got it until now.</li>
 <li>Make it work on more platforms/browsers. Lots of trial and error has to be
     done to make it work with 'Opera'.</li>
 <li>You can always make the code clearer, smaller, better, faster, ... :-)</li>
</ul>


<h3>4 Information</h3>

<h4>4.1 Supported browsers and platforms</h4>

<p>
Here is a very incomplete list of browsers and platforms known to work with
digilib. We provide three different navigation-scripts to work with different
implementations of JavaScript in different browsers. These are Netscape 4,
Internet Explorer (working on versions 4 - 6) and the Mozilla5-engine. Due to
some bugs in the browsers and special behaviours of different platforms we
cannot garantee that digilib works on every platform supported by for example
the Mozilla5-engine. Anyone having success on a different platform than the ones
indicated below, please send a note.
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Netscape 4.7x (Windows, MacOS 9.0/9.1, MacOS X, Linux, Solaris)</li>
 <li>Mozilla 0.9.x (Windows, Linux, MacOS X)</li>
 <li>Internet Explorer 4.01+ (Windows)</li>
 <li>Internet Explorer 5 (MacOS 9.0/9.1, MacOS X)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is known and already mentioned that 'Opera' is currently not supported by
digilib, but still this is some task that is planned for the future.
